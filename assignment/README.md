For this Tier 1/Week 1 assignment I was compelled to share a few hobbies of mine, as well as share a little bit of where I come from. I also shared one of my favorite quotes from Max Ehrmann.

In this project I used HTML, CSS, and lite JavaScript.

The most difficult part of this project was setting the margins using HTML and CSS.
